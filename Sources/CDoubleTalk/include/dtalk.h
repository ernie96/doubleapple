 * immediate stop, index markers, pull PCM as it is generated).

 * Audio format: unsigned 8-bit mono PCM at dtalk_sample_rate() Hz (10504,

 * speech-rate period table in our private in-RAM firmware copy (never the
 * on-disk ROM): smaller periods = proportionally faster speech at every nS
 * value, with pitch unchanged (the table drives frame duration, not F0) and
 * without touching the parser.
 *
 * level 0 = authentic (stock table, the default). levels 1..dtalk_rate_boost_
 * max() are progressively faster, each a verified-safe operating point (pitch
 * stable, speech intelligible, no firmware fault at any nS 0-9). Out-of-range
 * levels are clamped. The setting persists across dtalk_reset() and applies to

 * The default is 3000 Hz - the RC8650/RC8660 datasheets' own recommended
 * "3 kHz Low-Pass Filter" output stage, i.e. the authentic card sound, and
 * the value MAME's resampler spectrally matches. Passing 0 restores that
 * default. Higher corners (up to a sensible fraction of the ~10.5kHz Nyquist
 * headroom) trade that authenticity for brightness by letting more of the
 * DAC's high-frequency content through; the argument is clamped to the
 * range 500..5000 Hz.
 *
 * Safe to call mid-stream: the filter's sample history is preserved, only
 * the coefficients are swapped, so changing the setting while speaking does
 * not introduce a discontinuity. Coefficients (and the chosen corner) persist
